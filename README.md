# amazon-price-tracker

Growing up I have always loved Music. After discovering my late grandfathers record collecting in highschool (~2010), I was hooked on listening and collecting records. 

As the years have passed, vinyl records have become more and more popular allowing record companies to release high quality 180g vinyl records. This increase in quality along with the price of vinyl has made record collecting a very expensive hobby. 

After years of shopping at various record stores and amazon.ca, I noticed the price of vinyl records can fluctuate alot. This is why I have decided to collect daily/weekly price data from albums from 25 of my favourite artists from amazon.ca. $25-30 per record has always been an ideal price for me, so I wrote some python scipt to send me an emial if any of these records drop below $30. Eventully, I will have enought data to analyze for price trends and insights and create an interactive dashboard to view record price history.
